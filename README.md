# flutter_quiz_app
## By David Berry

Written in Dart and using the Flutter framework, this app is a quiz app.

The control flow is:
- User selects which quiz to do
- User answers each question as it comes up from a list of multiple choices
- After each answer select, a popup dialouge show giving some information about the question topic
- At the end of the quiz, the user is presented with the number of questions they answered correctly
- The user can then restart the quiz or return to the initial screen to select another quiz

Features:
- The order of appearance of the questions is randomized each time the user starts a new quiz.
- The user can return to the initial screen (the quiz selection screen) by clicking the home icon in the app bar.
- Each question has multiple choices, ranging from 1 choice to 4 choices.
